Absolute To Relative Paths
************************************************************************
.. Note::
 Although it should work for any program, I've only tested it in Maya. Use with
 a grain of salt

The abs2rel script is meant to speed up the process batch renaming files/folders
within applications so that absolute paths can very quickly become relative
without much user interaction. The script was actually originally designed as a
companion for :doc:`syncmeisteruser`, but I figured that this tool was too useful to
not make a quick GUI out of it (Hence why they both basically have the same GUI)
