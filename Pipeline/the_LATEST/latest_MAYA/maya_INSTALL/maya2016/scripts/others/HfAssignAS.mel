//	HfAssignAS(string $attractorSetName)
//
//<description>
//	Attaching an attractor set to a surface associates the attractors in the set with the surface so that they affect the fur descriptions
//	attached to them. If you have already created an attractor set, you can attach the set to any selected surface. You may have created
//	the attractor set without attaching it to the surface, or attached it to other surfaces when you created it. 
//
//<flags>
//      None.
//
//<returns>
//		None.
//
//<examples>
// // Step1. Select the surface you want to attach attractors to. You can attach more than one attractor set to a surface. 
// // Step2. HfAssignAS $attractorSetName;
// //        where $attractorSetName is the name of the attractor set you want to attach.
