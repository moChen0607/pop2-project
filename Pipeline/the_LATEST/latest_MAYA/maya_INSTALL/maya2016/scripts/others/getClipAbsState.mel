global proc int getClipAbsState(string $clipName)

//  Description:
//      Determine whether a clip's channels are relative, absolute or a 
//      mix of the two

//  Input Arguments:
//      $clipName - the name of the clip we'd like information about
//
//  Return Value:
//      0 - All channels on the clip are relative
//      1 - All channels on the clip are absolute
//      2 - Some channels on the clip are relative
//
