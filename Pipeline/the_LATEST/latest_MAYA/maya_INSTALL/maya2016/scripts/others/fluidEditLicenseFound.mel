//  Description:
//      Helper proc for fluid license checking.  Needed since
//		lots of fluids menuItem functionality is in MEL scripts,
//		and any MEL script that needs to check for a fluid license
//		can't be guaranteed to succeed until that slice has been
//		both dynamically loaded and initialized.  The only way
//		to guarantee this happens is to call a command from MEL
//		(not a script!) that will bring in the required slice.
//
global proc int fluidEditLicenseFound()
{
	if (`about -ltVersion`)
	{
		return false;
	}

	if( `about -batch` ) {
		// Dummy command that doesn't do anything or
		// spit out any warnings or error messages...
		// But only execute if dynSlice isn't already
		// loaded.
		//
		int $loaded[] = `dynamicLoad -q libDynSlice.so`;
		if(( size( $loaded ) == 0 )
		|| ( $loaded[0] == false ))
		{
			fluidCacheInfo -pb -hc {};
		}
	}

	return `licenseCheck -mode "edit" -type "fluids"`;
