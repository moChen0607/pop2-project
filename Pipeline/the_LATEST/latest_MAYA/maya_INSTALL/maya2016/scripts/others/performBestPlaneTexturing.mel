//  Description:
//      This script computes the #components to be mapped and passes that
//		count as an argument to the underlying command along with the
//		entire selection list.  
//
//		NOTE: 
//			The selection list also contains the other components that define
//			the projection plane.		
//
//  Input Arguments:
//      Polygonal components to be mapped
//		Other components to be used for plane computing
//			(usually locators, vertices, CVs etc)
//
//  Return Value:
//      None.
