//  Procedure Name: 
//		connectNodeToNodeOverride
//
//  Description:
//		This procedure is provided as a hook for customers to allow
//		you to redefine the behaviour of drag and drop. 
//		
//  Input Arguments:
//		$srcNode - the name of the source node (the dragged node)
//		$dstNode - the name of the destination node (the dropped-on node)
//
//  Return Value:
//		Return 1 if you want Maya continue and perform the operation 
// 		that would normally result from this connection.
//		Return 0 if you have chosen to implement a different behaviour
//		for this connection and don't want the normal operation to 
//		be performed as well.
//
global proc int connectNodeToNodeOverride(
	string $srcNode,
	string $dstNode)
{
//	print(
//		"connectNodeToNodeOverride(" 
//		+ $srcNode
//		+ ", " 
//		+ $dstNode
//		+ ") called\n");

	// By default the return value of this procedure is 1, so that Maya
	// will perform the normal operation for a connection between these
	// two nodes.
	//
	int $rDoNormalOperation = 1;

	// 
	// If you wish to change the behaviour of drag and drop of a node onto
	// another node in Maya use the callback 'connectNodeToNodeOverrideCallback'. 
	//
	// Typically this procedure would get called when a node is dragged onto a
	// node in the multilister, hypershade or hypergraph (when not in DAG
	// view).
	//

	int $thirdPartyDoNormalOperationRequests[] = `callbacks -executeCallbacks -hook "connectNodeToNodeOverrideCallback" $srcNode $dstNode`;

	for ($thirdPartyDoNormalOperationRequest in $thirdPartyDoNormalOperationRequests) {
		if($thirdPartyDoNormalOperationRequest == 0)

			break;
