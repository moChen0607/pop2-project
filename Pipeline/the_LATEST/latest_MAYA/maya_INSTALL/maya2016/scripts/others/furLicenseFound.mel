//  Description:
//      Helper proc for fur license checking.  Needed since
//		lots of fur menuItem functionality is in MEL scripts,
//		and any MEL script that needs to check for a fur license
//		can't be guaranteed to succeed until that slice has been
//		both dynamically loaded and initialized.  The only way
//		to guarantee this happens is to call a command from MEL
//		(not a script!) that will bring in the required slice.
//
global proc int furLicenseFound()
{
	return `licenseCheck -mode "edit" -type "fur"`;
