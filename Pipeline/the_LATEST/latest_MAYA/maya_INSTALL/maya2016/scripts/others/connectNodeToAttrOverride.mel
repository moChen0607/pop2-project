//  Procedure Name: 
//		connectNodeToAttrOverride
//
//  Description:
//		This procedure is provided as a hook for customers to allow
//		you to redefine the behaviour of drag and drop. 
//		
//  Input Arguments:
//		$srcNode - the name of the source (the dragged node)
//		$dstNodeAndAttr - the name of the destination (the dropped-on attr)
//
//  Return Value:
//		Return 1 if you want Maya continue and perform the operation 
// 		that would normally result from this connection.
//		Return 0 if you have chosen to implement a different behaviour
//		for this connection and don't want the normal operation to 
//		be performed as well.
//
global proc int connectNodeToAttrOverride(
	string $srcNode, // ie) checker2
	string $dstNodeAndAttr) // ie) lambert1.normalCamera
{
//	print(
//		"connectNodeToAttrOverride(" 
//		+ $srcNode
//		+ ", " 
//		+ $dstNodeAndAttr
//		+ ") called\n");

	// By default the return value of this procedure is 1, so that Maya
	// will perform the normal operation for a connection between these
	// two nodes.
	//
	int $rDoNormalOperation = 1;

	// 
	// If you wish to change the behaviour of drag and drop of a node
	// onto an attribute in Maya, you should implement the behaviour you 
	// wish here. 
	//
	// Typically this procedure would get called when a node is dragged onto an
	// attribute in the attribute editor in Maya or when a node is dragged onto
	// an object in the 3d view.
	//
	// This is one likely procedure that you would want to implement to
	// change Maya's drag and drop behaviour. For example, if you were a game
	// developer and you wanted to allow an artist to drag and drop a texture
	// onto an object in the 3d view with meaningful consequences, you would
	// implement this method to recognize that action and assign shading
	// groups/create shading networks/etc as appropriate.
	//

	// connect mental ray shader to mental ray render globlas "contour store" and "contour contrast"
	if( $dstNodeAndAttr == "miDefaultOptions.contourStore" ||
		$dstNodeAndAttr == "miDefaultOptions.contourContrast" )
	{
		connectAttr -f ($srcNode + ".message" )  $dstNodeAndAttr;
		return 0;
	}

	return $rDoNormalOperation;
}
