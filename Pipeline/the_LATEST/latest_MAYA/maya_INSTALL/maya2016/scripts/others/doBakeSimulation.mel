//	Procedure Name:
//		doBakeSimulation
//
//	Description:
//		This is the actual function that calls from the "Bake Simulation"
//		option box.
//
//	Input Arguments:
//		$useTS    true : use the current time slider range for the simulation
//				  false : use the $start and $end values for the simulation
//		$start, $end   : only applicable if $useTS is true
//		$by : the increment from start to end time of simulation with which
//			  to view frames and capture keyframes
//
//		$below  0/1 : bake on selected items only, or all below
//		$control    0/1 : if 1 and a transform above a shape is selected,
//						    bake animation of all control points also
//		$shapes      0/1 : if 1 and a transform above a shape is selected,
//							bake attributes of shape as well
//							(excluding control pts)
//		$imp 0/1 : if we're baking attributes that are controlled by an
//					implicit animation (i.e. with no explicit DG connections),
//					then if 1, turn off this implicit control after the
//					bake is complete (e.g. turn off the IK handle's
//					effects after baking skeleton joints, controlled by IK)
//		$useCB 0/1 : if 1, set keyframes on attrs specified in channel box
//		$preserveOutsideKeys 0/1 : if 1, preserve keys that are ouside the bake
//                                 range when there are directly connected anim 
//                                 curves
//
//	Return Value:
//		None
