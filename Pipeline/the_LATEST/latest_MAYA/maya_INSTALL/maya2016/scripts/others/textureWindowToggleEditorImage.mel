global proc textureWindowToggleEditorImage ( string $editor )
//
// Description:
//		This script is to be used with: textureWindowBakeEditorImage.mel 
//		and textureWindowEditorImageUtils.mel.
//		They were written, along with some c-plus-plus source changes, to
//		address the fact that the image displayed in the Texture Editor may
//		be cropped, or may not be the correct resolution.
//
//		This procedure will load a previously baked texture into the
//		Texture Editor Window. The Image Range of the Texture Editor Window
//		will be set to the Image Range used when baking the texture to
//		ensure proper visualization.
//
//		If a file texture has not been baked for the combination described
//		by the selected object, its current uv set, and assigned texture
//		then an error is issued.
//
//		There will no notification, however, if a previously baked texture
//		has been invalidated. A baked texture will be invalidated by any
//		modification of the 2d Texture Placement Node associated with
//		the texture node. It is the responsibility of the user to rebake
//		all affected file textures after any modification of the Texture
//		Placement Node.
