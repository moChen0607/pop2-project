//  Description:
//      animSweep operates on NURBS curves, generally that are animated.
//	It will take snapshots of the curve at each of the times between a
//	min and max time with an increment, copy the curves
//
//  Input Arguments:
//		float	minTime		- start time of sweep
//		float	maxTime		- end time of sweep
//		int		ts			- if true, use the time slider range for the
//							  min/max times of the sweep; otherwise use
//							  minTime and maxTime.
//		float	by			- increment for snapshot of objects to sweep
//		float	hist		- if true, keep history on after the sweep is
//							  finished, so that changes to the original
//							  animated object will affect the swept object
//		int		deg			- degree of swept surface produced
//		int		uniform		- if true, make the swept surface w. uniform knots
//		int		close		- if true, make the swept surface closed
//		int		poly		- if true, make the swept surface a polygonal object
//
//  Return Value:
//      Returns the number of swept surfaces that were produced
//	(one per selected animated curve)
//
