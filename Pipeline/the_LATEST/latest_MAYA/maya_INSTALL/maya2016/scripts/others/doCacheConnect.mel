//		Connect an existing cacheFile node to an existing blend node.
//		If the no objects are specified, connect the first channel
//      of the cache file node to the first object controlled by the blend.
//      If an array of objects and channels is specified, connect to
//      the blend such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between
//      the specified objects and the specified cache channel.
