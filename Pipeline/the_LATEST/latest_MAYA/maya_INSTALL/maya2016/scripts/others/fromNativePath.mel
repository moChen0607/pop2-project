//<synopsis>

//    string fromNativePath( string )

//<keywords>

//		MEL Windows path file

//

//<description>

//		Convert from '/' to '\' path formats on Windows, otherwise does nothing.

//		This proceedure can be used to try to unify path data to use the

//		forward slash character (a safer and more cross-platform way of

//		handling paths, since the forward slash is what Maya uses internally

//		to separate path names).

//

//<flags>

//      string $path

//          The path to be converted.

//

//<examples>

//		string $native = "c:\\examples\\scripts\\second\\city";

//		// Note the double backslashes used in input - in MEL, backslash is

//		// a special escape character and for it to be understood as the 

//		// backslash character, two backslashes must be used

//      string $path = fromNativePath( $native );

//		// Result: c:/examples/scripts/second/city // On Windows

//

//<returns>

//      string: The converted path.
