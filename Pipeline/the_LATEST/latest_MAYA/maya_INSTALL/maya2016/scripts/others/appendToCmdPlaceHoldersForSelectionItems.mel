//  Description :
//      Say the cmd expects n selection items. The proc here
//      appends %1 %2 ... %n as place holders in to the string
//		$cmd.
//
//      For example : intersect expects two selection items.
//      We have the cmd : "intersect -ch true -fs 0"
//      After the call : "intersect -ch true -fs 0 %1 %2 ;"
//
//	Subsequently use 
//		executeCmdOnItems( $cmd, $items).
//
