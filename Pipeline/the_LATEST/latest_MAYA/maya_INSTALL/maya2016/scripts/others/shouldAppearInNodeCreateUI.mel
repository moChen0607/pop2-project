	Description:
	    shouldAppearInNodeCreateUI makes a check based on node type 
		$type and certain environment variables, and returns a boolean 
		value.

		Returns true if a node is not in the list of types to be excluded,  
		or if the variable MAYA_EXPOSE_FACADE_NODES is set. Returns 
		false otherwise.

		Currently the facade types as follows:
		- materialFacade
		- envFacade
		- AISEnvFacade
