global proc string findPanelPopupParent()
//
//	Description:
//		Find the paneLayout under the mouse pointer.  A popupMenu can be attached to this layout
//		for hotkey-enabled marking menus.
//		If no paneLayout can be found under the pointer, this method returns "viewPanes".  This is 
//		so that the user is not annoyed by error messages when they mistakenly use the wrong hotkey
//		on a non-panel window. ("viewPanes" is Maya's main paneLayout)
//
//  Returns:
//		The paneLayout name.
//
