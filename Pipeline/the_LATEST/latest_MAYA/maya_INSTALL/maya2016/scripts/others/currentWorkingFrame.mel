global proc currentWorkingFrame( string $mode )
//
//
// Creation Date:  20 October 1996
//
//
//  Procedure Name:
//		currentWorkingFrame
//
//  Description:
//		Stores or returns to the users
//		"current working frame", based 
//		on a mode passed into the procedure.
//
//		This allows the user to scrub through
//		the timeslider to see the effect of
//		changing a keyframe, and quickly
//		return to that point again to affect
//		other changes, without having to
//		precisely hit the frame with the
//		timeslider.
//
//  Input Arguments:
//      $mode, either "store" or "goto".
//
//  Return Value:
//      None.
//
