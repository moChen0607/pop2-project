//  Description:
//		Since localizable MEL resources are now accessed
//		through "uiRes( keyID )", we use initResources() to
//		initialize the language-appropriate string values
//		associated with each keyID.
//		
//      First, we source the default (English) version of
//      the resource script.  (This lets us create a
//      baseline that we can always fall back to.)  In case
//      a localized, non-English resource script is missing
//      a required key-value pair (or the file is missing
//      altogether!) we can at least display the English
//      default value instead of bailing on the generation
//      of the UI or not knowing how to display the missing,
//      non-English text.
//
global proc initResources( string $file ) 
{
	global string $gResourceFileList[] = {};

	// If we've already processed this file, don't re-source it.
	//
	if( stringArrayCount( $file, $gResourceFileList ) == 0 ) {
		
		// Create English baseline.  This must be found or we're in
		// big trouble.
		//
		eval( "source \"" + $file + "\"" );
		
		// Keep track of processed files so we don't source them
		// twice.
		//
		$gResourceFileList[ size($gResourceFileList) ] = $file;

		// When language preference set to anything but English,
		// source the localized resource script to layer the new
		// resource definitions on top of the existing English baseline.
		// 
		string $languagePath = languageResourcePath( $file );
		if(( $languagePath != $file ) && ( $languagePath != "" )) {
			eval( "source \"" + $languagePath + "\"" );
		}
	}
