# Grey To Color Ramp
# This is a shader expression to start up a color ramp.  The $inValue
# would be the incoming grey or float value.  This can be used to 
# remap an incoming grey pattern to the ramp you define.
# By default it's bringing in $Cs which would be the value of the node
# above

$inValue= $Cs;
$outColor =ccurve($inValue);
