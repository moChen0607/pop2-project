# Grey To Curve Spline
# This is a shader expression to start up a curve spline.  The $inValue
# would be the incoming grey or float value.  This can be used to 
# remap an incoming grey pattern to the ramp you define.
# By default it's bringing in $Cs which would be the value of the node
# above

$inValue=$Cs;
$outColor =curve($inValue);
