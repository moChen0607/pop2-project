#
# Description:
# 		Maya 2009 project definition files (workspace.mel) are no longer
#		compatible with older versions of Maya. Old project definition
#		files can still be read into 2009, but you'll need to convert
#		2009 workspace.mel files with this script in order to use them
#		with pre-2009 versions of Maya.
#
# Arguments:
#		inWorkspace 	- 2009 workspace.mel file to convert
#		outWorkspace	- resulting pre-2009 compatible workspace.mel file
#
