Simple decorator definitions that are generally useful.

	Use this decorator to force a class method to be really private
	(i.e. raises an exception if you try to access it from outside the class).

		@private
		def myPrivateClass(self):
			doSomeInternalWork()

	You can still use the double-underscore name mangling trick to hide the
	actual name of the method if you want to as well:

		@private
		def __myPrivateClass(self):
			doSomeInternalWork()
