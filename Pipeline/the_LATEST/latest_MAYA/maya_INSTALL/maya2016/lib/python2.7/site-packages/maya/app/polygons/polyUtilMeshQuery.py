This module wraps around Maya's internal commands and api functions
for querying polygon objects. It provides a class base abstraction to
store vertex and faces. 

The main class is polyUtilMeshQuery.  When called this class will hold
onto empty list of mesh primitives.  It must be initialized with a
Maya mesh object by calling the gatherFromMesh method.  After that
point all list objects will be populated with the current values of
the mesh at the instance in time that it was queried.

The class does not store any pointer to Maya objects in the scene. So
it acts as a container for stats on the mesh.  This can then be used
in unit tests to make comparison between mesh states or simply as a
convenient way to access the mesh data.

		a way to save the current polygon state, revert it back to
