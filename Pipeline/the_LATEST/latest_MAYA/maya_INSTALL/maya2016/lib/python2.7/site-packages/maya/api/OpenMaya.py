# The API 2.0 lib is named _OpenMaya_py2 to avoid conflicts with the
# API 1.0 lib (_OpenMaya) and the C++ lib (OpenMaya) during packaging.
#
# However, we don't want users to have to do this:
#
#		import maya.api._OpenMaya_py2
#		maya.api._OpenMaya_py2.MGlobal.displayInfo('contrived example')
#
# we would rather that they could do this:
#
#		import maya.api.OpenMaya
#		maya.api.OpenMaya.MGlobal.displayInfo('contrived example')
#
# To that end we import _OpenMaya_py2 and copy all of the symbols from its
# dictionary to our own, thus making it appear as if they are part of
# our module, which is called 'OpenMaya'.
