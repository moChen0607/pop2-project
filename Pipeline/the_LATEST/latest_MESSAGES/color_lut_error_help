Unable to load local transform catalog
/home/(@#*$&/maya/synColor/Shared//shared_catalog.cat

My system specs
Distributor ID:	RedHatEnterpriseClient
Release:	6.5
Maya2016

I have an issue where my workstation at school will not allow maya to boot from the command shell. I've tried a variety of solutions so I'll try to be brief and list my symptoms and solutions

On our work machines, the maya alias command through the terminal points to /usr/local/bin/maya and the shelf icon that comes on the machine points to /usr/autodesk/maya2016/bin/maya2016, a separate location. If I click the shelf icon, maya starts without a problem. If I attempt to use the maya alias or the longform name, /usr/local/bin/maya, I'm greeted with an error with the following message Unable to load local transform catalog
/home/(@#*$&/maya/synColor/Shared//shared_catalog.cat. 

Followed by a core dump

Error: Unable to load transform catalog: /home/ckenne24/mount/stuhome/maya/synColor/Shared//shared_catalog.cat

Here's the kicker. If I try to use the shelf button after having run this command, Maya won't load anymore and I receive the same error. Likewise, use the command that the shelf command uses directly, (as stated before), /usr/autodesk/maya2016/bin/maya2016, I get the same error and the shelf button doesn't work again.

The workaround would normally be "just use the shelf button" but the problem is, I'm working in a group environment and it's absolutely essential that we can run Maya from the terminal, so that we can define environment variables with .sh scripts. I've taken certain steps to fix the problem but none have been successful so far


Here's what I've done:
1. Use the shelf command directly in the terminal - /usr/autodesk/maya2016/bin/maya2016. Result::Error
2.
