Maya - Absolute To Relative Paths User Guide
*******************************************************************************
Our school has a problem with our installation of RenderMan, which causes paths
to be saved as absolute paths, despite how it may appear relative in Maya's
GUI. The working solution for people so far (especially during Finals) has been
to open Maya files in a text editor and search/replace files to clean them up.

My solution is simply to make the save button work as it's supposed to.

Summary
===============================================================================
I've identified one of the reasons this problem occurs - If a project is set to
path, that set directory gets added to a file's path on save. The obvious
solution would have been to simply never set your project at all - but then
the Maya scene files wouldn't work. It's a very brutal Catch-22.

Luckily though, there is one thing to remember - The paths ARE relative in Maya
and if we query them with getAttr, they come back as relative strings. This is
the basis of my solution.

Goals
===============================================================================
  - Force Maya to save properly with the paths that the user specifies
  - Because this solution will be distributed to multiple groups who may or may
    not know me as a programmer, I want to give them piece of mind by being
    able to backup files before executing the string overwrite
  - The string overwrite and the scene file backup, should be toggleable
  - This function set should be integrated into Maya's save, to keep my script
    unintrusive
