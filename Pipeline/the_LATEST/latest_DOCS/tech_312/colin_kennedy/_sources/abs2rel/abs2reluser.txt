Absolute To Relative Paths
************************************************************************
This page is for the express reference of people that need to use the tool. It
will have the most updated visuals. If you're looking for the developer page,
the :doc:`abs2reldocumentation`, or the :doc:`abs2rel` project description,
please go to the following links above.

.. Note::
 Although it should work for any program, I've only tested it in Maya currently.
 Use with a bit of caution.

The abs2rel script is meant to speed up the process batch renaming files/folders
within applications so that absolute paths can very quickly become relative
without much user interaction. The script was actually originally designed as a
companion for :doc:`syncmeisteruser`, but I figured that this tool was too useful to
not make a quick GUI out of it (Hence why they both basically have the same GUI)
