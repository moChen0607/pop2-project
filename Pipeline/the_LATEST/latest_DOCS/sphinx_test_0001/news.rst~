News - |project_long_name|
**************************
For all things related to distributing information and pushing updates to the
user, this module was created. Application-specific modules (such as, for
example, a node in Maya/Nuke/Houdini that stores metadata about the current
scene) will be placed in their respective folders but application-independent
information will be documented here.

The changelog page is located here :doc:`changelog`

.. Considerations::
 Right now, there are two versions of the changelog. One that uses this
 documentation (Sphinx + Read The Docs + Napoleon) to get changelog information
 and the other simply takes changelog information from a text file. The two
 were made entirely in isolation. If there's time, the two should be rewritten
 with ducktyping and implement the same methods, to avoid confusion in the
 future.

Changelog - HTML Parser
=======================
The most automatic version of the changelog. Right now it's simply written
procedurally simply as a result of time-crunch.

.. autofunction:: news.controller.htmlparser.get_html

.. autofunction:: news.controller.htmlparser.get_changelog

Changelog - Local File Version
==============================
Note, this module has been deprecated in favor of the HTML Parser, because
keeping a changelog separate from our documentation page makes little to no
sense.
